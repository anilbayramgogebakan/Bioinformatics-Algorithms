there are some libraries which must be installed before run the program. These libraries 
are mentioned in the "Requirements" section.

	$ make install
		This step will install the required libraries.
	$ make run
		This step will run the code.
	$ make clean
		This step will clear the .pyc files that might be created after running the program.

Requirements:

Files:
	hw0.py: This file contains the matrix operations. It takes two input: "n" is for 
the number of dimension and "s" is for the scalar value that mentioned in assginment.
